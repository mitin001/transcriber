# [Episode 3.4](https://www.tvfanatic.com/the-best-tv-shows-to-watch-when-youre-feeling-petty/): management advice from Logan Roy

Logan shows what to say to your subordinates if they start to expect you to do the work for them.

> I gave you a destination. I canâ€™t walk you there.

He explains that in life, there are no lines that can't be crossed or moved.

> Nothing is a line. Everything, everywhere is always moving. Forever. Get used to it.

Do not cloud your judgment with traditions or norms. Always be aware of your environment and act in the way it demands. Move with the flow, crossing the lines if you have to, if that's where the current throws you.
