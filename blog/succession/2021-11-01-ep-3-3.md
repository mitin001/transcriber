Media shapes culture. We value big houses because we see them on television, but we only see them on television because big houses can accommodate television cameras.

> Most television that you watch is chosen on the basis of how easy is the place to film in. So in most television that you watch, people live in really quite large, spacious houses in a way that I think creatively has an impact because eventually over time, people start thinking, "Why do I live in this little shitty house when everyone on television seems to have bigger houses?" And it's purely because they want to be able to fit all the cameras in nicely. So normally, choices like that come out of a practicality that has a very subtle but pervasive effect over the whole course of art.

The Russian remake of *Married with Kids* is completely unbelievable to most Russians. Who can afford to live in a house like that?

Unloved people are more drawn to power.

> If you can't have love, the next best thing is power.

Maslow's hierarchy of needs explains this.

> People who have love withheld from them can be driven just to have power, just to feel safe, because actually, when you are powerful, you are more safe.
