> Talking about why rich people want to go to space or New Zealand or wherever the hell they want to escape...

Why do these rich people want to go to space or retreat to their own private islands?

Because they live their lives in cashmere prisons. Lavish but lonely, increasingly more insulated and guarded, with too many people surrounding them and no privacy.
