In _Succession_, Logan Roy dies on his private jet in mid-air. His children say their goodbyes to him over the phone. He cannot hear them because he had already died.

> Saying _I love you, Dad_, at any other point in life, even at the time of his death, you would get a silence perhaps back. And so the time that you want it to be answered the most, you're still getting silence. And so there's never a satisfaction there.

This is not unlike how he was in life. He would never return their children's affection.

> Very few of us in life ever get that unconditional love that should be every child's due.

Unloved children grow up to be emotionally immature people.
