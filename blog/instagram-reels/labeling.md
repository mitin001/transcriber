Use labeling to get anyone to do anything.

> You essentially wanna give somebody a label of how you want them to act. And when you put an expectation on somebody, they naturally want to reach that expectation.

_I love how short our meetings are. You always give me so much time back, and I appreciate it_. Maybe this will get my supervisor to stop yakking and end the meeting early for once.

> To my customer during a sales call, I say like, _oh, finally I'm on a call with somebody that's decisive and knows exactly what they want_. I say this earlier on into the sales pitch. That way they have to live up to that expectation at the end of the sales call. AKA, they're not very likely to tell me _I need to think about it_ at the end of a call because I labeled them as decisive and they agreed with it. So they're gonna act in that way.
