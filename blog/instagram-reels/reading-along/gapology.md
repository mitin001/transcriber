> A structured approach to uncover and address these performance barriers.

When a coworker has a performance problem, it may be due to a knowledge gap.

> This gap arises when individuals or teams lack the necessary skills or information to excel. It’s not about effort—it’s about awareness and capability.

If this happens, the company hasn't done a good job training or mentoring the person. Its culture may not be conducive to learning.

> Provide targeted training and mentorship. Make resources readily accessible.	Encourage continuous learning and knowledge sharing.

Other performance gaps arise when there are unclear expectations, poor communication, incorrect priorities, or lacking accountability.
