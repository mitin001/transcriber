Trump puts tariffs on Chinese goods. China retaliates and puts tariffs on American goods.

> China can actually keep up those high tariffs on us as long as they want to, even if those tariffs do hurt their own economy and their own consumers. Why can they keep that up indefinitely? Because, oh yeah, they're a dictatorship. They don't have to care about their people
or what their people think. They don't answer to their people.

Trump behaves as if America has already fully transitioned to an authoritarian regime. But America will never become authoritarian because the American people have had a taste for freedom. Once you're born free, you won't give your freedom away without a flight. This is the fight we have to fight as Trump tries to take this freedom away from us.
