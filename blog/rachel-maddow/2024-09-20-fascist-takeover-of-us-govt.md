# [2024-09-20](https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/transcripts/2f6f30458209f1856bde444adf0e96e7.csv): the QAnon propaganda has made people okay with Trump's fascist takeover of the US government

Trump doesn't care that his actions qualify to be called a fascist takeover of the US government.

> What we're going to do, some people will call it a fascist takeover. But that's not, you know, any concern to us. It's what we're going to do. So we're not going to care when they call it a fascist takeover. Because after all, our so-called democracy is a sham anyway. Would it really be so bad to give it up? Since we all know who's really in charge.

He doesn't care because his base has accepted the conspiracy theory that the government has already been taken over by the Jews, secret societies, etc. So they abide what he's trying to do. This is exactly the outcome he was hoping for when disseminating the QAnon propaganda.
