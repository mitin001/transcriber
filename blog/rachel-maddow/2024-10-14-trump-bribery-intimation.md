The limited-edition Trump watches are a way for foreign leaders and criminals to buy favors of the President of the United States.

> Hello, foreign enemy country or organized crime leader. Would you like to pay me a million dollar bribe while I'm here running and on the precipice of becoming President? If you would like to bribe me, just buy 10 of these supposed watches, and I'll never send them to you, but I'll keep your million bucks and I'll pay you back somehow once I'm President.

Meanwhile, Trump wages the war of truth about him. He threatens those who control how facts about him reach the public.

> He threatened to criminally prosecute Google because he does not like the search results that Google produces about him.

Putin didn't like that Wikipedia provided facts about his invasion of Ukraine, so he banned Wikipedia in Russia.
