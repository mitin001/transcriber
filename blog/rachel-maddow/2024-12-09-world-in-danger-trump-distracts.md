# [2024-12-09](https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/transcripts/e0c43887b21d2bc2350a3895255211b3.csv): the world is in danger while Trump distracts America

> It is a complicated and dangerous world out there, especially right now. There is nothing about the quality of this presidential transition that should set anyone's mind at ease about how well America is going to be handling these matters.

The world is on fire while America is trapped in a reality television nightmare.

> In a blink of an eye, we've had the government collapse in Germany. We've had the government collapse in France. We have had the imposition of martial law and an attempted overthrow of the government in South Korea. We have had the toppling of the Assad regime and potentially a wholesale realignment of all the major powers in the Middle East, all while we are in between the end of one presidency and the beginning of another. But don't worry, Elon Musk's mom is sitting in on the meetings. Jared just got both his ex-con dad and his college roommate really cool jobs. And people have almost forgotten about the child sex trafficking attorney general nomination and the other guy supposedly selling presidential appointments and the rape allegation in the police report about the defense secretary nominee and the Unabomber fan for the explosives job and the health secretary who says a worm ate part of his brain and then died in there Nnw asking potential hires into the U.S. government how much they like sex and do they like to show off their bodies.

Trump is using the high profile that comes with running a campaign and conning his supporters into voting him into office to sell anything from guitars to smells.

> Literally since winning the election and becoming president elect, he started selling guitars this weekend. He literally started selling smells, new Trump fragrances, Trump-branded odors in a bottle.

His cabinet is similarly corrupt. The exploit Trump's manufactured fear of vaccines when selling his gullible followers sugar pills.

> Trump's choice for FBI director who will sell you pills that reverse the COVID vaccine.
