A federal judge appointed by Ronald Reagan speaks out against Trump and in support of the rule of law.

> There are moments in the world's history where people look back and ask, _Where were the lawyers? Where were the judges?_ In these moments, the rule of law becomes especially vulnerable. I refuse to let that beacon go dark today.

As Trump continues to violate the law in his takeover of government, lawyers and judges stand in his way. Meanwhile, the dismantling of the government continues. His cabinet lets a young immature and dangerous Elon Musk fan ruin the department in charge of keeping the American airspace safe.

> Who among us doesn't feel better about having a 19-year-old with links to Russia and famous criminal hackers who goes by the online handle Big Balls in charge of American air traffic control?

This kind of irresponsible stone throwing is why the judges are protesting.

> Courts generally assume that the other branches of government are acting responsibly and show them deference. In this case, Mr. Musk has shown that he doesn't deserve any deference.

The people in Trump's circles are hoping to wear out these judges so they can complete their fascist takeover of the government.

> They're certainly hoping that the courts will get fatigued.

> Your diagnosis of the problem is unsettling. Does it come with a prescription?
