Trump tries to shut down USAID thinking it would be easy to get the American people to go on with this.

> Maybe preservation of democracy and decency abroad is an abstraction relative to the price of eggs.

The news of the USAID shutdown is met with cheers from dictators of other countries.

> When the worst people on the planet are giving you a standing ovation, it's worth asking exactly why that's true.

It gives Trump and those in his circles no pause that his actions benefit the most repressive regimes in the world.
