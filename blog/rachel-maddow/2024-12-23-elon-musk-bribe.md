Tesla received a software update on Thanksgiving Day in 2022, which immediately caused a massive accident.

> A Tesla in San Francisco that was in full self-driving mode inexplicably stopped on the highway and caused an eight-car pileup.

Tesla had to report this crash to the government because there was a rule requiring crashes in self-driving mode to be reported, but after Elon Musk bribed Trump, crashes like these were no longer required to be reported to the government.

> For the low, low, low price of financing one presidential election, Tesla may have bought itself a US government that among other things no longer requires Tesla to report when its self-driving software causes wrecks and hurts and kills people.
