Elon Musk bribes Trump into reshaping the government in such a way that only benefits Musk.

> This guy paid for the presidential election. Therefore, he kind of bought himself a government and so he gets what he wants.

As for the US citizens who haven't personally bribed Trump, the government no longer works for them.

> Hey you kids getting off school buses, watch yourself. Unless and until you can start paying for your own president, you're fair game on the side of the road.

When one of Musk's cars malfunctions and runs over a child, there will be no consequences for Musk or any pressure for his company to build safer cars in Trump's America.
