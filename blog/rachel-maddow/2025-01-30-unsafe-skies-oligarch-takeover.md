Elon Musk's rocket crashed, prompting the head of the FAA to ground the SpaceX Starship program. As soon as Trump got into the White House, he fired this person for his audacity to stand up to Musk.

> Inauguration day, the head of the FAA, the FAA administrator was gone, gone from his job. Elon Musk was rid of this FAA director who had grounded his rockets because what? An entertaining little crash which forced emergency diversions of dozens of passengerplanes packed with humans? In September, while Elon Musk was busy spending the quarter billion dollars that he dumped into Donald Trump's campaign to make Donald Trump president again, Mr. Musk had posted a picture online of the head of the FAA and had demanded his resignation.

Elon Musk gets what he wants out of this government, making our skies more dangerous in the process. When an American Airlines plane collides with a military helicopter in D.C. shortly after, Trump blames this crash on diversity. Rachel Maddow notes that the incompetence does not seem to be coming from the diverse workforce of the FAA, but rather from Trump's orbit.

> Look at all of the cable news hosts. The one guy's got the little jacket and the other guy's blurting out information on service members who have been killed. The president himself says he thinks he might get wet if he visits the crash site because it's a river.

Trump refuses to visit the disaster site to comfort the nation while his cabinet picks fumble the communications about the disaster.

> At least Elon Musk is getting what he wants and what he needs from the U.S. government. Are we?

It only took a presidential candidate who would be willing to take Elon Musk's bribe to allow our government to become an oligarchy.

> The word oligarchy seems to stick in everybody's craw. It sounds like somewhere between like an ancient word and a foreign word. People don't like the word, but people who study how oligarchy works around the world would tell you that this is like a perfect case study, a textbook case. Man with tons of money effectively purchases politician. Politician then changes the government so it meets the personal and business needs of the rich guy to whom he belongs. That change in government is bad for everybody else. Like, for example, times like this, it might be good if we had an FAA. But even though what the politician is doing is bad for all of us, bad for everybody else in the whole country except for the rich guy, we're supposed to think we can't do anything about it because after all, it's this rich guy who's buying the elections now. And so our voice doesn't matter. That's what we're supposed to think. And that's how this is supposed to work. But in our country, it is not working out the way they hoped because the American people broadly and deeply say they dislike this eccentric right-wing billionaire who's getting his own personal government while the rest of us get the shaft.

Rachel Maddow remains hopeful that the American people won't allow this to go on much longer.
