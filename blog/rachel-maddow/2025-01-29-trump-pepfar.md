Trump tried to cut PEPFAR.

> The HIV treatment program that is credited with saving 25 million lives.

The effect of this could be disastrous. These drugs keep this virus from spreading and thus adapting to evade treatment.

> ...a brilliant way to mass manufacture new strains of drug-resistant HIV to share with the whole world, including the United States, since drug-resistant HIV is what you get when you start people on treatmentand then take them off it. Then, other people who get that strain of HIV can't take the drugs to keep them alive, and we go back to HIV being deadly instead of a manageable disease.

Bringing us back into the 1980s when HIV was deadly, is that what Trump meant when he said he was going to make America great again?
