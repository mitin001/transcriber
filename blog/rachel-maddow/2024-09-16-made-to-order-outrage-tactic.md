Instead of Trump's defeat in his debate with Kamala Harris, the media talks about his unfounded allegations that Haitian immigrants are pet eaters.

> He likes this framing. He wants us to be talking about this trash, even if it's being debunked. He wants this to be the main subject of discussion in the country instead of, I don't know, Kamala Harris beating the pants off of him in that debate and him humiliating himself by showing himself unable to talk about anything other than ego-driven concerns related to himself.

This is deliberate misdirection from Trump.

> If you're taking like a midterm exam or a final exam, you have no clue what any of the answers are, and you're definitely going to fail that test, why not get up and pull the fire alarm? I mean, yeah, you might get in some kind of trouble for pulling the fire alarm, but you failing is no longer going to be the story. It's made-to-order outrage. And the press was supposed to learn something about dealing with this in 2016, 2015.

Trump has used this tactic since his first successful presidential campaign, and we're still falling for it.

> This is a tactic. We were supposed to get better at not having our chains yanked. After living through this experience since 2015, we are almost 10 years into this now, the made to order outrage from Trump and his cohort are designed to get us talking about that outrage rather than any other issue that might more reasonably frame the real stakes of an election or the real threat of Trump's presidency.

This is dangerous because by focusing our attention on the reality television salacious drama, we are not noticing how the US is descending into an authoritarian state.

> It keeps the discussion on things he's framing rather than on what the election might otherwise be about.
