With paramilitary groups allied with Trump, he will be able to covertly direct violence toward anyone in disagreement with him.

> Authoritarian rulers all over the world have always liked to have paramilitary: loyal but unofficial perpetrators of violence and menace to work on their behalf, to intimidate and hurt anyone in opposition, to make it too scary for normal people to participate in politics or civic life, to make everybody who might oppose Trump in any way worry about the thugs that might turn up at their door. Trump pardoning and releasing from prison the January 6th defendants, including the paramilitaries, means he is effectively immunizing his followers from committing violence in his name. He's making clear, *you know, if you support me, the law doesn't apply to you*. Not incidentally, the people he's pardoning and their families will feel like they owe Trump everything and that they therefore should and now can do absolutely anything for him.

When Putin launched an invasion into Ukraine, it was initially groups like Wagner that did the dirty work. He similarly hid behind paramilitary groups when he wanted to have covert military presence in Syria.
