If you can easily manipulate the public opinion, there is no need for accountability.

> Republicans convinced themselves that Trump’s and his allies’ failures were actually triumphs, creating an accountability-free dynamic in the wake of a tragic U.S. response to the century’s most dramatic public health crisis.

Elements of disinformation include a big lie with exclamation points, appeal to emotion, and agreeable nods from those with authority or apparent credibility.

> Republicans would replace an accurate story with a fictional one by repeating a baseless lie, adding exclamation points, throwing around scary-sounding phrases such as “suitcases full of ballots” and “ballot dumps,” and waiting for party members and their allies to nod their heads in agreement.

Disinformation is dangerous. In an effort to make their COVID response to not seem like the disaster it was, the GOP accidentally persuaded their base to reject all vaccines. With this, the fringe antivax movement suddenly became mainstream.

> The more Republicans took steps to rewrite the story of the federal response to Covid, the more the party’s attitudes toward the larger issue took dangerous turns. The revised story of the pandemic left GOP officials and their supporters more hostile toward science, more skeptical of subject-matter experts, and more amenable to fringe conspiracy theories. Perhaps most important of all was the degree to which many Republicans turned against vaccines. In August 2021, Trump held an event in Alabama—one of the nation’s most reliably red states, where the Republican ticket won by twenty-five points a year earlier—and encouraged attendees to take full advantage of Covid vaccines. The booing was audible and immediate. Four months later, at an event in Texas, he acknowledged having received a booster shot, at which point he was again booed by his supporters. The former president has long enjoyed an almost religious reverence among his die-hard supporters, but the mere reference to safe, free, and effective vaccines during a pandemic sparked a harsh response. A year later, the Republican headlined a rally in Alaska, and clearly wanted to take credit for the lifesaving Covid vaccines that were developed during his term, but he grudgingly conceded that “vaccine” was a word “that I’m not allowed to mention.” Mindful of the direction of the prevailing political winds in his party, the former president dramatically changed direction. In June 2023, Trump abandoned his earlier positions—two years earlier, he practically begged people to thank him for the development of Covid vaccines98—and told an audience in Georgia that if elected to a second term, he intended to end federal funding for “any school that has a vaccine mandate . . . from kindergarten through college.”

One step in the descent into authoritarianism is to have the public believe that voting is unreliable.

> Dan Coats, Trump’s former director of national intelligence, wrote an op-ed reminding the public that the United States’ enemies abroad “want us to concede in advance that our voting systems are faulty or fraudulent.”

The Confederacy lost the Civil War in 1865. But Civil War reenactors make it seem like they never conceded. And on January 6th, 2021, the Confederate flag finally reached the Capitol.

> The Confederate flag that never reached Capitol Hill during the Civil War, but which was carried down congressional hallways in January 2021.
