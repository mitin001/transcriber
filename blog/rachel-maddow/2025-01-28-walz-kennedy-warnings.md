Trump barks out orders to cut government spending and then goes out golfing.

> Donald Trump's reckless action cut off funding to law enforcement, farmers, school, child care, veterans, and healthcare. While he was out golfing, he threw the country into crisis. This is not bold, it's not leadership. It's stupid, buffoonish, childish.

As he enjoys himself, the government is left in disarray as its workers scramble to keep it functioning in the face of the uncertainty he created.

> Most folks were up all night last night as we dealt with this being thrown on there.

Tim Walz expressed his exasperation of Trump's poor leadership.

> Not one damn person thought this through.

This is the speech of a man tired of the incompetence at the top.

> ...in response to the Trump White House's sudden, inexplicable freeze on all federal funding. Governor Walz and state officials were sent scrambling overnight to try to deal with the expected impact of roughly $2 billion in federal funding for ongoing programs being yanked instantly and with no warning.

He explains those around Trump that know better rationalize this to themselves as a necessary step to test the government to see which programs can be cut with minimal backlash.

> This is a trial balloon to see how much tolerance we had and what we pull back.

If this sounds reasonable to you, stop. Don't have high hopes for a government full of thieves, sycophants, and dictator wannabes.

> It's like you caught someone and they stole everything out of your house. You caught them and you told them to put it back. And when you start looking, some of it's still gone. What they're gonna see is, *oh, they didn't raise a stink about meteorologists or our folks who are monitoring PFAS in our water. So let's just go on with that. Or people that we don't think have a voice that we wanna marginalize and demonize*.

Listen to anyone who knows these people well.

> Bobby has gone on to misrepresent, lie, and cheat his way through life. Bobby is addicted to attention and power.

This is Caroline Kennedy speaking about her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., one of Trump's cabinet picks.
