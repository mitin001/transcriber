This is what it means to be a government worker in Trump's second term in office.

This is what happened to those working for USAID shortly after Trump took office. He thought that it would be easy to sell to the public that the US should no longer send aid abroad. Dictators of other countries do not want American aid to reach their people because it makes it harder for them to carry on their repressions. Trump's interests are aligned with those dictators and so he demonizes USAID as leftist and uses that as a pretext to shut it down.
