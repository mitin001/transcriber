# [2025-02-10](https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/transcripts/b28973d3060237cdd785c2c70f3d17cd.csv): no more security for our financial transactions or the State Department

Your financial transactions are no longer secure. Elon Musk is getting rid of them. He wants to turn Twitter into a payments system like Zelle, and he wants to use his proximity to the President to differentiate his payments system from the rest of the market. Specifically, he wants there to be no government oversight of it.

> They want to fire the financial cops, but they'd like for nobody really to notice that. And particularly, Elon Musk would like nobody to notice that he just wants to get rid of them before he launches his new financial product.

One consequence of this is that there will be no more oversight of any financial transactions. Meanwhile, bypassing background checks allows him to hire walking time bombs into the government. One such person was looking for a job in the government because he was just fired from the private sector.

> Edward has been terminated for leaking internal information to the competitors. This is unacceptable and there is zero tolerance for this.

This person now has full access to the U.S. State Department data.

> After Edward, the intern, was fired, he reportedly posted online that even after the company had fired him for leaking company information to a competitor, Edward had managed to get himself access to "every single machine at that cybersecurity firm that had fired him." He bragged that he could have wiped all the company's customer support servers if he had wanted to. Edward, that fired intern, is now older and wiser. He's now 19 years old and he now works for the president's top campaign donor. And in that capacity, 19-year-old Edward is now a "senior adviser at the U.S. State Department", where he now has been given access to all of the IT and data management functions for the country's entire diplomatic operation in every country on Earth.

And so just like our financial transactions, our State Department is also no longer secure.

> It doesn't sound good. Kind of does sound like a national security concern to have a 19-year-old who already in his young life has a history of leaking sensitive information. And then to give that 19-year-old access to all centralized data at the U.S. State Department.
