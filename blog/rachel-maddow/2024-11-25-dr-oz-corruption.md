Dr. Oz endorses a private insurance peddler that employs cohersive practices to get vulnerable people to switch from their Medicare plans to those that send these telemarketers kickbacks.

> After filling out an online form to get insurance information, within three seconds I began getting bombarded by phone calls. When I asked the representative to stop, she said the auto dialer would not stop until I provided my information. I don't know how to get them to stop after 18 calls in an hour and a half. I am 64 years old and this is causing me unnecessary stress.

There are many complaints people like these and their loved one leave on Better Business Bureau's page for this company. One such complaint is by a son of a deaf 86-year-old with dementia.

> This insurance agent somehow convinced his deaf elderly father with dementia to dump his health insurance plan that he'd had for more than 20 years in exchange for a plan that the person on the phone was hard selling him on in these repeated phone calls.

The son sees the Dr. Oz-endorsed company for what it is: a fraud.

> Clearly this company is conducting fraud and financial elder abuse. The company that's the subject of these complaints is essentially a telemarketer that targets people who have Medicare. So the company calls people up and tries to convince them that they should dump their Medicare plan run by the federal government and instead switch to a private alternative.
