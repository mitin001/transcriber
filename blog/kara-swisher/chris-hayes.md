Microsoft executive Linda Stone once told Kara Swisher that in the future we won't be giving anything our full attention. We will all be in a state of...

> ...continuous partial attention.

In other words, we're spreading our attention too thin. Chris Hayes seems to agree.

> Attention is the most valuable resource of our age. It's the defining resource of our age. And it is also the substance of life. It is. Our life will be, in the end, moment to moment, what we have paid attention to, what we have ignored. And there is something profound at a philosophical level about the thing that is most essential to us, the substance of our lives being extracted from us, often in a way that feels against our will.

...And in my case, I'm giving this away willingly through this blog.

> In our lifetimes we have already seen the non-commercial internet defeat the commercial internet once. That the first version of the mass internet was AOL CompuServe and Prodigy, and it fell to the open web.

Blogs proliferated at the time of the open web. They will usher in a new golden age of open Internet.

> We could have another open Internet.

The walled garden model of the Internet did not serve us well. It gave us Donald Trump.

> If Roosevelt was the radio president and JFK was the TV President, he's the internet troll President.

Trump is not a politician. When you say someone is like a politician, you mean someone who's exactly the opposite of what Trump is.

> You're describing someone who wants to be liked by as many people as possible and is kind of a glad hander.

You're not describing Trump.

> You're not describing a polarizing troll. And what Trump realized is that the methodology of polarizing troll is a more effective means of wielding power in our age.

Trump welcomes negative attention and the outage. It's a vulnerability created by the current model of the Internet that he's glad to be exploiting for his personal gain.

> Most politicians, if you give them a choice between negative attention or no attention, they're like, _I would rather have no attention. I don't want to make news because I don't want to polarize people against me because fundamentally I have to get people to like me_.

The business model of Facebook did it to us. They've sold us out to corporations, and now the scammiest businessman in the world wants to turn our government into a scammy business.

> Facebook is purely an attention company. Their business model is not that different in its essentials as Benjamin Day's business model for the New York Sun when he invented the penny press, which was you basically give away the product for free and then you sell the audience as advertising. And that's what Facebook does. They do it at a scale that would have been unfathomable to Benjamin Day.

Cable news did it to us, too.

> The constant stream of breaking news alerts were reintroduced after a ratings dip.

In their desperation to remain relevant, they've introduced dishonest ways to keep people watching.

> Killer bees. It could happen to you. Trans fat. It could happen to you.

They've captured our attention by fearmongering. That's another way Trump has captured the attention of his base. 

> You have to lean in and watch.

You can't turn away from the trainwreck, and now we are on that train. Chris Hayes says we will survive this. There are people who will help us through this. He says he isn't like the others in the cable news business. His mission is to inform his audience.

> To give them the information and tools necessary to engage in democratic self-governance.
