For a bank account takeover, a criminal needs to build a fullz.

> TLO and Delvepoint are both skip tracing software. It delivers the complete background check of that individual. Oftentimes includes driver's license scans, socials, all these, I mean, just a complete background check. Those are outstanding if a criminal has access to it.

Without access to the skip tracing software, the criminal must build a fullz manually.

> I start by going to some place like Robo-check.cm. Criminal database, lists the social security numbers of about 170 million Americans, social security numbers, dates of birth. I buy your social, your date of birth there for $3.80. Now I've got that. From there, I go and get your background check. Where do I go? I start to use legal services like BeenVerified, Spokeo, Intelius, White Pages Pro, and People. For example, BeenVerified lets me look up unlimited background checks for I think $27 a month right now. I can look up however many background checks I want to. So I pull your background check, every single associates of yours in the hopes of getting your mother's maiden name, which I'll get. From there, I get the credit report. Where do I go? Why go the exact same place you go. Annualcreditreport.com. Why? Well, they ask security questions there, but there's no time limit on the security questions. Meaning, I can sit there. I can literally sit there all day long with the background checks with Google, try to get the correct answers. ... If I miss some of the questions and don't get the back of the credit report there, am I worried? No, I'm not, because my next stop is Credit Karma, where they ask the exact same questions except the answers, except for the correct answer is different. So now I've got your credit report. Go to LinkedIn to find out where you work. Glassdoor, find out how much you make. Finally, I pay a visit over to Facebook to find out if you've posted anything of interest.

Once you have a fullz, you can initiate an account takeover. You have to get customer service to change the phone number they have on file. Calling customer service with a spoofed phone number is not enough to get them to do that.

> Call into customer service and immediately say, Hey, can you update my phone number on file? Even though it's showing the correct phone number, I've not established enough trust for customer service to do that. They're probably going to boot me up to higher security, more verification. I'm trying to avoid that.

You have to establish a level of trust with a customer service rep.

> How do I get them to take care of it? I create a diversion. I cause a problem. We solve the problem. I verify even more who I am and then distract them the entire way while building and establishing more trust. So I miss the mother's maiden name, creating a problem and a diversion. But don't worry. We're going to solve this problem together by answering more KBA, more knowledge-based authentication questions. We're going to solve this issue together. And I'm going to establish more trust with you by proving even more by answering these questions that I am who I claim I am. That's going to distract you.

You have to also exploit their interest in getting you off the phone as quickly as possible.

> I know that since you're going through 300 calls a day, I get you distracted. I build, layer more trust on top of that. I know that you're already looking forward to... Once that problem is solved, you change the mother's maiden name, you give me the available balance, I know at that point that you're mentally disengaged from my call because the issue has been solved. You're already looking forward to the next call. It's at that point, at that point that I come in and say, "Oh, by the way,	can you update the phone number that's on file?" "Yes,	we can."

However, this is not necessary anymore. Thanks to Genesis, there's already malware sitting on your victims machine waiting for them to access their bank. Once they do that, Genesis delivers a cookie to the criminal who uses it to make fraudulent transactions from the victim's bank account.

> Criminal comes in right after the actual account holder comes in, sends out Zelle payments, sends out ACHs. Guess what? The bank doesn't realize that it's an account takeover and the bank thinks it's the actual individual that's sending out those funds, meaning that you're not covered with fraud protection.

Genesis makes it so criminals no longer have to talk to customer service over the phone to take over their accounts.

> These type of marketplaces are changing the way that account takeovers take place. They're changing the success rate of it. It used to be, like I said, I'd go on the dark web, I'd buy account credentials to take over your account, I wouldn't get the cookie. Oftentimes, I wouldn't get the browser fingerprint. I wouldn't have the correct IP range or anything else like that. So I'd have to worry about IP range. I'd have to worry about the cookie, the fingerprint. There are all these different areas where that potential account takeover would fail. That's one of the reasons that a lot of criminals would oftentimes result of picking up the phone. You don't have to worry about an IP or a device coming in if you're simply picking up the phone to take over an account.

A credit freeze is one way we can protect ourselves from account takeovers.

> Freeze the credit of every single person in the house. Credit freezes became free September 18th, 2018. Okay, you have to contact all three credit bureaus. They're going to try to talk you into putting some sort of credit monitoring or alert process in place. Screw that. Tell them you want a credit freeze. They're free and they work great for stopping new account fraud.
