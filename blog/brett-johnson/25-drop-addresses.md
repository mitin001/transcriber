If one needed to order illegal things from the dark net (e.g., drugs, fake IDs), where should one have them mail to?

> You could search for houses that were for sale in your area. And then you would go down and you would look at the house and figure out that was a proper drop address.

A drop address! A house for sale. It can even be an apartment for sale.

> You would pick up an apartment guide, you'd go through and you'd find an apartment complex, you'd call the apartment complex, act like you were going to rent an apartment there, ask all the pertinent questions, how much is it, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. As the call was ending, you know, I'll come in and fill out the application. *Oh, by the way, can you give me an apartment number of an empty apartment so I can call the utilities companies and get the, you know, the average utility bill per month?* And the apartment manager would always give you an empty apartment number. Well, that empty apartment number then became your drop address. From there, you would have to figure out, okay, what time does the mail run, USPS, UPS, FedEx, and usually you would have to go down there and kind of camp out to figure out when it would run. Or sometimes you could ask the apartment manager, *what time does the mail run usually over there?*

When this person is on his way to pick up their clandestine mail, they will bring landscaping company flyers with them just in case to get them out of a sticky situation.

> I would carry around flyers for landscaping. So if I went on a porch, if I was doing porch piracy, which that happens when you're doing drop addresses... If I was doing porch piracy or just new account fraud, something like that, and I went up on a porch and somebody just happened to open the door, I would say, Oh I was just moving this package out of the way so nobody could see it. Oh, by the way, I'm offering landscaping services.

This person will pick a house on a densely populated street because that's where people trade vigilance for privacy.

> I like the houses close together because it tends to be that a lot of the neighbors, they pull their front blinds so no one can see in. Well, guess what? No one can see in. You're right. But that also means that no one can see out. So no one's paying attention to what's going on in the neighborhood.
