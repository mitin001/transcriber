LeGrand has an advantage in porn thanks to the size is his penis. But Jason sees Photoshop as a way to erase this advantage.

> If you got a bunch of dudes photoshopping, they could end up being bigger than you.

Jason asks LeGrand if he feels slighted by the fact that he has to compete in the market where performers without this natural advantage gain it artificially my photoshopping themselves.

> You could be losing out on business because they're willing to Photoshop and you're not.

LeGrand disagrees.

> I don't believe in the law of scarcity.

> ...where just because you do well means I'm going to do less well. I don't buy that.

LeGrand thinks there are enough people on the planet to make everyone rich. That is, everyone who wants to sell something and needs paying customers. There are so many people in the world, you will always have enough paying customers as long as you're doing your job well regardless of the tools you want to use to help you do your job well. LeGrand sees the use of Photoshop to promote an image of a person as no more dishonest than using makeup. He references an early Photoshop ad noting the superiority of this Adobe product over physical makeup.

> The best makeup in the world is Adobe.

Photoshop is post-production makeup.

> There's like pre-production makeup, which is like the physical thing. And there's post-production makeup, which is Adobe.
