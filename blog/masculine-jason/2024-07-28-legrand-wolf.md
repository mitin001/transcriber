LeGrand makes an end-of-the-world prediction, and it involves religion.

> Religion will ultimately be the cause of the demise of humanity.

Religion is concerned with self-perpetuity within the human populations but would not mind it if all human populations were to be eradicated.

> Religion isn't particularly concerned about the survival of the species.

It actively harms the human populations by propagandizing ideas detrimental to their survival.

> It acts against our interests as a species. It only acts to preserve its own power and its own belief structure. And oftentimes that can act in opposition to what is going to help us survive as a species.

Religion clashes with our efforts to ensure continued survival of our species, e.g., the work of climate scientists.

> It's more important that people uphold the belief that exists within a religion than it is that they preserve the environment within which they are living.

Religion always makes itself the priority in a person's life over anything else. Religious people may choose religion over their own lives or the lives of their children.

> The belief is more important than your wellbeing or the wellbeing of your children, and belief must be preserved.

George Carlin has spoken of the contrast between individuals and groups where people have a tendency to betray virtues and morals as soon as they start forming groups. LeGrand Wolf explains this as a religious influence on the groups.

> They get people as a group to act and behave in a way that they would not probably act or behave individually.

LeGrand grew up in a mormon family. His family members turned against him over his homosexuality because of their mormon beliefs.

> It's gonna be pretty hard to get a family member to harm another family member at scale, but you can get family members to harm family members at scale with mechanisms that kind of control a group, and mechanisms that control a group effectively are kind of a core belief
that everyone kind of subscribes to.

So LeGrand has left the mormon religion. Now he uses his deep knowledge of this religion to make mormon porn.

> You know where you should have older religious leaders
having sex with the 19- and 20- and 21-year-old men? That should exist in porn, not in real life. That's the outlet for it. So it's not disgusting.

He condemns the fact that church leaders often take advantage of their power positions to demand sexual favors from their young peritioners. At the same time, he makes movies that depict it. Capturing a fantasy on video and experiencing it as a viewer of such a video is moral. Attempting to recreate such a fantasy in real life by using and coercing real people is immoral.

> It's fantasy material.

LeGrand's porn business thrives. Now that he's made a name for himself by telling the mormon sex fantasy, his next contribution to the field is to have it embrace AI.

> You'll be able to upload images of yourself and then have your favorite performer fuck you in those images.
