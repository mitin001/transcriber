> Why are groceries still so expensive? Why has inflation decreased but food is still 25% more?

Do grocery prices go down after inflation? No, grocery prices are affected by the price level, not inflation. The price level is defined differently.

> ...the general or average level of prices of goods and services in the economy. Inflation is different, though. It's an increase in the price level. It's the change, not the level.

The price level does not generally go down. The wages go up to keep up with the price level.

> You'll see this spike in the price level, and people start demanding raises and will get used to higher sticker prices at grocery stores.

This is one reason to ask your employer for a raise.

> Over the last year or so, the wages of Americans have been going up, and they've been growing faster than overall grocery prices.
