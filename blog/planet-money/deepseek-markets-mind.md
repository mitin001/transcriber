Emerging technology has got the market on a leash because it can quickly disrupt it, and everyone wants in on the gold rush. The latest emerging technology to do so is artificial intelligence. It affects more than software company stocks but also hardware and energy stocks.

> People wanted a way to invest in the AI future, and so they were pouring money into nuclear stocks, including, of course, our nation's biggest nuclear provider, Constellation Energy.

So much so, shares of an energy company could inflate almost 10x simply in anticipation of higher demand for energy brought on by compute demands of training AI models.

> Over the last three years, Constellation went from, like, 40 bucks a share to, like, $300 because the markets thought our AI future needs all the nuclear energy.

And as soon as anyone so much as hints at being able to train a model without much energy, the balloon of overinflated energy stocks pops.

> The stock price of Constellation dropping off - that is a market collectively saying, *oh, crap, maybe the future doesn't require as much electricity as I was betting on*.

That someone was the Chinese company DeepSeek.
