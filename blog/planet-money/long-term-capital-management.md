# [Long Term Capital Management](https://www.npr.org/transcripts/1232862544)

Long Term Capital Management were famous for their relative value trades.

> They saw that one bond or stock cost too little relative to another very similar bond or stock.

They found instances where market was wrong when it determined the value of something.

> They bet on Russian debt denominated in rubles because everyone else was more scared of it than they needed to be.

They had to make a good case for why the market was wrong because then they could be sure what direction the price would go when the market would self-correct.

> Step one-- find something underpriced, and find something similar that's overpriced. Then they have to figure out why those discrepancies might exist.

Similarities to other stocks make a strong case for these kinds of predictions.

> Step two, explain why that opportunity exists. Come up with a good explanation and understand what directions the prices should go.

Until the market self-corrects, their money would be tied up in stocks.

> You had to decide whether the reasons that were causing it were going to get stronger and make it go further apart, or whether they were going to dissipate over time and whether there would be a convergence. In many cases, the idea was just to hold it long enough so that they had to converge.

Hence the name _Long Term_ Capital Management.
