# Device and Browser Fingerprinting

You should have no expectation of privacy when browsing the web.

> Even when users disable common tracking mechanisms such as third-party cookies, Web sites and third parties can still track users based on environmental, contextual, and device information that the device returns to the server. Based on a collection of this information, a third party may be able to uniquely identify, or ’’fingerprint,’’ a user across different sites and over time.

The browser can list the fonts installed on your device and identify you based on that.

> Canvas font fingerprinting, which identifies a device based on the browser’s font list.

It can identify you based on how worn-out your battery is.

> Web sites can also use browser APIs to retrieve other information for tracking devices, including information such as the battery status, which can be used to track a user based on battery charge level and discharge time. Other reports describe how knowing the battery status of a device can be used to track a device and therefore associate a device with a user.

It can identify you based on many other metrics.

> Differences in font rendering, smoothing, dimensions, and some other features may cause each device to draw an image differently, and the resulting pixels can serve as a device fingerprint. The technique was first discovered in 2012, but not brought to public attention until 2014.

By using a combination of metrics like these, websites will know who you are with near certainty even if you have third-party cookies disabled. Nowhere is safe.
