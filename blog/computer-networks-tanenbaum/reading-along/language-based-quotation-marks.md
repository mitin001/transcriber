# [Language-Based Usage of Quotation Marks](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-6/#G8392)

> In European typography, it is common to use guillemets (single or double angle quotation marks) for books.

Opening and closing quotation marks are the same symbol in Swedish books. In languages where they are different symbols, they have directionality. The quotation marks face out in French and in in German. The low-9 style quotation marks generally adopt the same directionality as the angle quotation marks, but there are nuances. For example, the low-9 style quotation marks can also be on the top or bottom of the line.

> French inserts space between text and quotation marks. In the French case, U+00A0 NO-BREAK SPACE can be used for the space that is enclosed between quotation mark and text; this choice helps line breaking algorithms.

Asian languages use white corner brackets and double primes for quotation marks.

> The glyph for each quotation mark character for an Asian character set occupies predominantly a single quadrant of the character cell. The quadrant used depends on whether the character is opening or closing and whether the glyph is for use with horizontal or vertical text.
