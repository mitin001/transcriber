# [What is base64 Encoding and Why is it Necessary?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-base64-encoding/)

> A very ugly practice that is somewhat similar to contraband. Data is obfuscated (well, really) in order to cheat a system that doesn't allow this kind of data.

SMTP only allowed 7-bit ASCII characters, so to send other characters through it, they had to be encoded. That's how base64 was created, and it's still widely used to sneak binary data in text files: HTML, CSS, JSON, etc.
