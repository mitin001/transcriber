# [Writing Direction](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/core-spec/chapter-2/#G6318)

Left-to-right is not the only writing direction. Some languages alternate between left-to-right and right-to-left writing, even in the same text.

> In most Semitic scripts such as Hebrew and Arabic, characters are arranged from right to left into lines, although digits run the other way, making the scripts inherently bidirectional.

Top-to-bottom, right-to-left is another popular writing direction.

> East Asian scripts are frequently written in vertical lines in which characters are arranged from top to bottom. Lines are arranged from right to left.

To convert these to left-to-right lines, do not rotate the characters.

> Such scripts may also be written horizontally, from left to right.

Texts written top-to-bottom, left-to-right are likely Mongolian.

> Mongolian is usually written from top to bottom, with lines arranged from left to right.

To convert these to left-to-right lines, do rotate the characters.

> When Mongolian is written horizontally, the characters are rotated.

Some even prefer alternating between left-to-right and right-to-left directions for odd and even lines.

> Early Greek used a system called boustrophedon (literally, “ox-turning”). In boustrophedon writing, characters are arranged into horizontal lines, but the individual lines alternate between right to left and left to right, the way an ox goes back and forth when plowing a field.
