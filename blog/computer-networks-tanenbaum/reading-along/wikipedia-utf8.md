# [Wikipedia. UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)

> Code points with lower numerical values, which tend to occur more frequently, are encoded using fewer bytes.

> It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII: the first 128 characters of Unicode, which correspond one-to-one with ASCII, are encoded using a single byte with the same binary value as ASCII, so that a UTF-8-encoded file using only those characters is identical to an ASCII file.

UTF-8 is self-synchronizing.

> ...letting a reader start anywhere and immediately detect character boundaries.
