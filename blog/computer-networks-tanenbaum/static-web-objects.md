Copyeditors in the 80s marked up documents to tell their colleagues how to format the page when it goes in print. Then, computers were recruited to aid in marking up documents. As a result, markup can now be done programmatically, and for this we have markup languages. For example, HTML (hypertext markup language) marks up hypertext documents to tell browsers how to display them.

> HTML is a markup language, or language for describing how documents are to be formatted. The term ‘‘markup’’ comes from the old days when copyeditors actually marked up documents to tell the printer—in those days, a human being—which fonts to use, and so on. Markup languages thus contain explicit commands for formatting. For example, in HTML,`<b>`means start boldface mode, and`</b>` means leave boldface mode.

Markup languages are not to be confused with word processor software.

> Microsoft Word is not a markup language because the formatting commands are not embedded in the text.

Word saves documents in the DOCX format, which is an extension of XML, another markup language (HTML also derives from XML). And yet, the formatting commands are not shown to the user explicitly when a DOCX file is opened in Word. Only their results are shown in a rendered document because the markup itself is not meant to be edited directly by user when it's in the DOCX format.
