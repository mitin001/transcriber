We live in the attention economy now. The two most powerful entities in our lives are the phone and the President. Chris Hayes notes that both got their power by exploiting our attention.

> You've got this sort of universe that public discourse is happening is engineered to compel your attention almost against your will, and then you've got this figure that dominates the news cycle now who does the exact same thing.

At Trump's inauguration, both of those forces came together.

> In that moment in the inauguration, when it's Trump up there and it's the CEOs of all of the platforms that are making billions of dollars off the monetization of attention, it's all the people who are extracting attention at scale for power in one single frame.

If you're surprised that there can be such a thing as phone addiction, you're not alone. Tech companies know us better than we know ourselves. They've studied our vulnerabilities.

> It's not the customer's job to know what they want.

One of the consequences of the attention economy is that listening to podcasts has become a more popular pastime than reading books.

> There is a supremacy of the spoken word and image over the written word.

This blog reflects this trend. Podcast transcripts are the largest source of blockquotes here. Even the heading for this page links to a podcast transcript.
