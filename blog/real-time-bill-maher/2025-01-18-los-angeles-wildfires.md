Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley mismanaged a wildfire. Bill Maher noted that she wasn't qualified for her position but Los Angeles might've overlooked this because they wanted a DEI hire.

> Am I against a lesbian being chief? Of course not. Do I think a lesbian can do the job? Of course I do. And maybe she's the best person for the job. Or maybe they really wanted a lesbian in that job, and she's just the best *lesbian* for the job. And with essential services, that's not good enough.

The wildfire disaster also exposed another group of people: the overly religious. The people who scream about their religion are the first ones to betray its principles.

> Where the sign used to be "In This House We Believe," and they took that one down and put up the "Shoot Looters on Sight" sign.
