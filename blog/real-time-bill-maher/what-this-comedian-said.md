# *[What This Comedian Said Will Shock You](https://www.google.com/books/edition/What_This_Comedian_Said_Will_Shock_You/bCToEAAAQBAJ)*

In his book, Bill Maher notes the tragedy of human nature.

> History is brutal, and humans are not good people. History is sad, and full of wrongs, but you can’t make them unhappen.

Fran Lebowitz had similarly noted that had human nature not been what it is, it wouldn't have been called human nature. Bill Maher seems to agree. In his telling, humans will find a way to do hard things, but they'll take cheap shortcuts. For example, they will make a group of people into scapegoats instead of confronting the real problem.

> It’s no secret there was no love lost between Kim Cattrall and the other ladies on *Sex and the City*, and yet they just found a way to work together again on a show about how men are always the problem.

They will march in protest against police brutality but not without turning stores into zoos.

> There used to be shame in shoplifting—or at least some skill needed. Now criminals just brazenly walk out of Walgreens—again, in broad daylight—with a trash bag full of aisle three, while the security guard just watches. They have to keep even the most mundane products all caged up; CVS isn’t a store, it’s a zoo for teeth-whitening strips.

They will brave through a pandemic but not without kicking and screaming.

> On airplanes now the in-flight entertainment is a fistfight.

The woke is trying to do something about this. They're trying to use cancel culture to change human nature. However, Bill Maher predicts that it's not going to work.

> If you’re part of today’s woke revolution, you need to study the part of revolutions where they spin out of control because the revolutionaries get so drunk on their own purifying elixir they imagine they can reinvent the very nature of human beings. Communists thought selfishness could be cast out of human nature. Russian revolutionaries spoke of “the new Soviet man,” who wasn’t motivated by self-interest but instead wanted to be part of a collective. No, it turns out he wanted to be on a yacht in a Gucci tracksuit holding a vodka and a prostitute, not standing in line all day for a potato.The problem with communism—and with some very recent ideologies here at home—is that its proponents think you can change reality by screaming at it, that you can bend human nature by holding your breath. But that’s the difference between “reality” and “your mommy.” Lincoln once said that you can “repeal all past history, [but] you still cannot repeal human nature.” But he’s canceled now, so fuck him.

The revolutionary idea of yesterday is that selfishness can be eradicated from human nature. The revolutionary idea of today is that biological constraints can be eradicated from the human body.

> The insane arrogance of thinking your revolution is so fucking awesome, and your generation so mind-bendingly improved, that you have bestowed upon the world a new kind of human, you’re welcome. With communists, that new human was no longer selfish; in America today, that human is no longer male or female. And obesity is not something that affects health, you can be healthy at any size.

Much like communist countries, the woke America is becoming a nation of snitches.

> Snitch Nation isn’t about what side you’re on, it’s about this mindset where everyone is an amateur secret policeman and tattling is a virtue. The woke side of the Internet thinks going through someone’s old MySpace account makes them part of the resistance.

They are on a futile mission to rid people of impurities through shame.

> Andy Warhol was wrong: in the future, everyone will experience not fifteen minutes of fame but fifteen minutes of shame.

Meanwhile, its detractors have their own snitching practices.

> Texas’s abortion law includes the idea that anyone even helping a woman get an abortion, like the Uber driver who takes her to the clinic, can be sued by some random Citizen Snitch for up to $10,000. Finally a way to tap into that vast reserve of Uber-driver wealth.

Ayn Rand is not all that intellectual. If you discover someone to be a fan of Ayn Rand, watch them closely because they may be an imposter, a pseudointellectual.

> Paul Ryan once said Ayn Rand taught him “what [his] value systems are.” And I believe him, because her book has a strange appeal to people who are kind of smart but not really. She wrote things like “Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue” and “The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me”—which sounds like something a Batman villain says. It’s all stuff that seems very deep when you’re nineteen years old, about how government is a dirty trick played by the weak on the strong.

Or, they may be a libertarian. Of libertarians, Bill Maher asks, where is the line between libertarianism and selfishness?

> Libertarians have to stop ruining libertarianism, or at least do a better job of explaining the difference between today’s libertarian and just being a selfish prick. Like, when you see a stoplight your reaction should be “Great. An easy way to ensure we don’t all crash into each other,” not “How dare the government tell me when I can and cannot go!”“Seat belts? I refuse to live in a nanny state—I’m an individual, and I want to soar, free as an eagle, right through the windshield.” Same thing with meat inspectors—who needs ’em? “People can sniff their own meat! And if a few die, the word will get around town: ‘Don’t order the T-bone at the Ponderosa,’ and then the Ponderosa closes—problem solved, thanks to the free market!”

You don't have to follow traditions, especially bad traditions. It's okay not to join a fraternity. You'll turn into a better person without it. Don't put yourself in a situation where you will have to waste your time deprogramming yourself from a cult.

> When a girl says, “I’m dating a frat guy,” no one ever asks, “Oh yeah, what’s he like?” “I just told you—he’s a frat guy.” Of all the bad things fraternities do, the absolute worst is that they take young people at the exact moment when they should be learning to be individuals and turn them into shit-eating, orders-following groupthinkers. My college had a lot of fraternities, but it never occurred to me to join one, because finally in my life I was able to live on my own, away from family and among women; it had no appeal when some frat guy said, “Hey, how about coming with me to live with a bunch of dudes? Come on, we’ll stick a carrot up your butt.”

There's no such thing as an elite college anymore. There's only expensive college.

> Elite schools should no longer be called elite—just say “expensive” now. Which may be why they breed a particular brand of detestable graduate.

In *Ministry of Truth*, Steve Benen noted that Republicans no longer allow any time to pass before they rewrite history. They rewrite history in the making of it. Bill Maher seems to agree.

> These guys are like Pinocchio, except when they tell a lie their balls grow bigger.

Capitalism breeds addiction. A successful product is an addictive one. The market will select a company that can best skewer regulations around addiction. The market does not select the most ethical company.

> When I heard this—that Apple, Google and Facebook are essentially drug dealers—I thought: “Where have I heard that before?” Oh yeah, it was on the famous 60 Minutes episode where tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand admitted, “We’re a nicotine delivery business,” and Mike Wallace said, “And that’s what cigarettes are for?” Wigand: “Most certainly. It’s a delivery device for nicotine.” Yup, it was never about “smooth tobacco flavor”; it was about the nicotine and other drugs that cigarette makers deliberately put in to make it addictive. The moral rot in this country began when corporate America decided it wasn’t enough just to successfully sell your product. People needed to be addicted to it.

Even though the alarmist attitudes about TV were largely misplaced, the alarmist attitudes about phones are valid.

> TV didn’t turn people into assholes: shady, needy, passive-aggressive, mean and fake: fake outraged, fake brave, fake pretty, fake supportive—phones make people fake their lives instead of living their lives. It’s more important to get a picture of you looking like you’re having a good time than actually having a good time. And the pathetic addiction to “likes.” “Did they like my picture? Maybe it wasn’t good enough… maybe that means I’m not good enough!” Phones have ruined self-esteem, comedy clubs, concerts, childhood, attention spans, sleep cycles, using toilet time to reflect and falling off cliffs. Oh, and dating, which has been reduced from a quest for true love to looking at a menu: “I think I’ll have the Kelly tonight.” Phones make people bullies. Angrier, more vitriolic, more racist online than they would ever dream of being if they had to say those things to someone’s face.

A former VP at Facebook admits that addiction to social media is destroying society.

> The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works.

To teach a young person why staring down at his phone during a conversation is rude, when he starts talking, open up a magazine and start reading.

> Cell phones have obliterated courtesy—the fundamental building block of developing any real relationship. We all see it—groups of friends out together at a bar or eating in a restaurant and they’re all staring down at their phones. Imagine how rude that would be if, instead of a phone, you brought a magazine to the table and read it during dinner with a “friend.”

Before speaking out about a purportedly offensive statement, first reflect on whether it is offensive in the first place. If it's directed at a particular community of people, ask that community whether the remark was offensive to them. We have become to jumpy, as in we started jumping to outrage at any trigger, no matter how minor. We have to snap out of these destructive impulses, and Maher suggests doing so through the power of deliberation and talking to the groups of people we believe to be acting on the behalf of.

> A hallmark of stupid wokeness: getting offended for people who themselves would not be offended. Democrats have gone from the party that protects people to the party that protects feelings. From “Ask not what your country can do for you” to “You owe me an apology.” Republicans apologize for nothing, Democrats for everything—can’t we find a balance?

We live in a time when a theater will slap a trigger warning on *Romeo and Juliet*.

> London’s Globe Theatre felt the need to tell the audience that its production of Romeo and Juliet includes suicide.

How can trigger warnings and spoiler alerts coexist?

> It does kind of give away the ending. I don’t understand how a society that’s so in love with spoiler alerts can also be into trigger warnings: tell me what’s gonna happen—but don’t tell me!

Market research doesn't work, questionnaires do not work. People will not admit their true nature. To find out who they really are, observe them.

> If you want to know who someone really is, ignore their avatar and check out their web browser history.

Most people are perverts.

> Look at a list of popular porn categories: cuckold, cheerleader, stepmom, double penetration, creampie, tentacle sex—it sounds like we’re playing Password for perverts.

And yet, college students are offended by everything nowadays. 

> Kids used to go to college and lose their virginity—now they go and lose their sense of humor.

For many, college is a drinking camp, a microcosm of a society trying to get through a pandemic or repressions.

> As long as I had liquor, I didn’t care that there was no toilet paper. But as a historical trend, this can’t be good. There’s a word for when everyone in society gets drunk just to get through the day. And that word is: “Russia.”

Bill Maher is on a crusade to rid society of stupid ideas. He thinks religion is a stupid idea.

> I’m the only live-action television figure who consistently puts religion “under attack,” and I’ll be damned if the credit’s going to go to the entire Left when I’ve been doing all the heavy lifting.

He laments that this is a quest often attributed to the whole of liberal media and resents this characterization.

> Where is religion belittled in the liberal world?

He notes that even those accused of satanic practices will thank God in their award speeches, should they win any awards.

> Counterculture types, like devilish musicians? Have you ever watched an awards show? Every speech is “I want to thank Jesus, without whom I could never have written ‘Face Down, Ass Up.’”

Religion is still considered a norm in the American society. Even in the 21st century it is unpopular to have no religious affiliation.

> Even an intellectual president like Obama, who admits to being a “secular humanist” (wink wink—atheist), had to pretend to be religious. No one has been able to admit their shameful secret: “I don’t believe in ghosts.”

At the heart of religion is the belief that human beings should be shamed and shunned for their sexual desires. An attempt to control people through this sort of emotional blackmail still drives many of our government's policymakers.

> This creepy substrain of Catholic conservatives who think “limited government” means government should put a limit on people’s sex lives.

Whereas Bill Maher sees religion as stupid, he sees American business as dishonest.

> How many times when you’re on hold have they asked you to “stay on the line after the call to answer a survey”? Why would I want to stay on the line after the call when I couldn’t get someone on the line during it? ... There was a recording that went viral about ten years ago of a Comcast customer service rep arguing endlessly with a customer who just wanted to cancel his service. It was eighteen minutes of a guy saying, “I’d like to cancel,” followed by… “Why?” “Doesn’t matter, just want to.” “Why?” “Please, I’m just looking to terminate.” “Why?” I’m no business expert, but I don’t think your customer service experience is supposed to feel like a car ride with a four-year-old. Comcast later apologized and said, “This is not how we train our customer service representatives.” Except for one tiny detail: it’s exactly how they train them. They’re not in the service industry—they’re in the small-print industry, and this is the new business model in America: annoying you out of your money. Wearing you down until you’re too weak to complain, and then when you just can’t go on, and die, charging you for early cancellation. Or just make something up and put it on a bill and hope no one notices. What the hell is a “resort fee” at a hotel?

Once corporations figured out that providing a service is not the only way for them to make money, it all went downhill very quickly. Now a leading tech company has convinced us that we each need to have the most expensive tech gear and then to throw away every year.

> The only people who really need you to get a new phone every year are the shareholders. But just because they need to sell it so they can jerk off the stock price, it doesn’t mean you have to stand in that nerd line and buy it. You’re not “early adopting.” In fact, quite the opposite; you’re taking too long to catch on.

You're taking too long to understand that capitalism cannot go on unchecked for too long. It must be kept in check by regulations passed by a government that also redirects some of its resources to services that are essential but not profitable.

> Republicans always think if you allow a little socialism it’ll spread out of control—but actually, it’s capitalism that has spread to places it never should be, like our health care system, our prison system and our news media. I’m not arguing against the free market—just not for everything. Socialism as an economic model replacing capitalism is a terrible idea, but socialism as a supplement to capitalism is good.

Social Security is an essential service often overlooked by those who denounce socialism.

> Florida’s Senator Marco Rubio says, “If you want to live in a socialist country, why not move to a socialist country?” You mean like Florida, where half the population is on Social Security? Yes, so many Americans hate the word “socialism” but love the concept.

We can't have functional roads in an exclusively capitalist society.

> Socialism is the reason you don’t have to bring your own highway when you want to drive somewhere.

More importantly, socialism is affordable healthcare, higher education, and social safety nets.

> Republicans think socialism is a one-way ticket to becoming the nightmare of Venezuela—they have a hard time understanding that done right, you don’t get “long lines for bread” socialism, you get “you don’t have to win the lotto to afford brain surgery” socialism. That’s the form of socialism that a lot of the happiest countries in the world embrace. There’s a reason the UN World Happiness rankings consistently list socialism-friendly places like Finland, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and Canada near the top. Because happiness isn’t only about what you have. It’s also about what you don’t have to worry about. All the countries on the list are ones with some form of universal health care. All have free or almost free higher education. All have strong pensions and social safety nets. Turns out, freedom from the fear of ending up in a tent below the overpass is a really great freedom too. It’s called peace of mind. Conservatives push the canard that unfettered capitalism makes you more free; but the right kind of socialism can make you the most free.

Nations that do socialism right not only keep order but also give their citizens peace of mind.

> There’s no sun half the year in a lot of these places, and they’re still in a better mood.

Meanwhile in America, pharmaceutical companies have invented the term _seasonal affective disorder_ so they can get people addicted to even more pills. That's the capitalist solution. Wouldn't you prefer the socialist solution to the happiness problem?

Bill Maher further criticizes capitalism as the economic system that has allowed the proliferation of cryptocurrencies.

> Capitalism, of course, has always contained an element where, instead of actually making something or providing a service for money, you could make money in the exciting field of money. But we knew money had to originate from, and be generated by, something real somewhere—to which cryptocurrency says, “No it doesn’t.”

Not only is cryptocurrency a ponzi scheme, it is also a huge waste.

> Cryptocurrency is literally a game. Bitcoins are created by what they call “mining”.

Cryptocurrency is a waste of compute power.

> This kind of mining involves using rooms full of supercomputers to make something that is purposefully arbitrary: essentially, one computer thinks of a number between one and infinity and other computers take trillions of guesses at what it is.

This translates to a waste of environmental resources. Like clean air. The data centers involved in Bitcoin mining output a significant amount of carbon dioxide and consume significant amounts of water to cool off the equipment.

> There’s something inherently not credible about creating trillions in virtual wealth with nothing ever actually being accomplished and no actual product made or service rendered. It’s like Tinker Bell’s light—its power source is based solely on enough children believing in it. Unfortunately, what is real is the unfathomable amount of electricity that those massive supercomputers suck up for their “mining.” The power being used right now to guess numbers and win imaginary prizes is the same as all the electricity needed to light all of New York City.

Their negative impact on the environment has earned cryptocurrencies and their proponents Bill Maher's condemnation.

> Almost all the people who tout Bitcoin and deal in Bitcoin and who won’t shut the fuck up about Bitcoin—the millennials, the Gen Z–ers, the Silicon Valley types—are the same people who see themselves as hip and progressive and big environmentalists. Bullshit. You’re money-hungry opportunists and you’re not allowed to pretend you care about the environment. According to the journal Nature, Bitcoin’s growth could single-handedly push global temperatures above the tipping point of two degrees Celsius. Because it’s a Beanie Baby that runs on coal. I know, melting ice caps can wait, your green new deal involves cash. Social scientists call this “cognitive dissonance”—a disconnect between who you think you are and what you actually do. I call it “being full of shit.”

Bill Maher opposes the colonization of Mars for the same reason. Those efforts are better focused on mitigating the environmental catastrophe here on Earth. Mars should not be our priority at this time in human history. It should be the survival of Earth as a habitable planet.

> If we’re going to spend the time, effort and money to make an entire planet sustainable for human life, why not the one that already has air and water and the right temperature and, oh yeah… we’re already here!

As the world faces existential threats, Americans are distracted by reality television. 

> Reality TV is acting: acting like you don’t know a glass of wine is about to be thrown in your face.

They like reality TV so much they turned over their government to reality TV personalities.
