In his book, Bill Maher notes the tragedy of human nature.

> History is brutal, and humans are not good people. History is sad, and full of wrongs, but you can’t make them unhappen.

Fran Lebowitz had similarly noted that had human nature not been what it is, it wouldn't have been called human nature. Bill Maher seems to agree. In his telling, humans will find a way to do hard things, but they'll take cheap shortcuts. For example, they will make a group of people into scapegoats instead of confronting the real problem.

> It’s no secret there was no love lost between Kim Cattrall and the other ladies on *Sex and the City*, and yet they just found a way to work together again on a show about how men are always the problem.

They will march in protest against police brutality but not without turning stores into zoos.

> There used to be shame in shoplifting—or at least some skill needed. Now criminals just brazenly walk out of Walgreens—again, in broad daylight—with a trash bag full of aisle three, while the security guard just watches. They have to keep even the most mundane products all caged up; CVS isn’t a store, it’s a zoo for teeth-whitening strips.

They will brave through a pandemic but not without kicking and screaming.

> On airplanes now the in-flight entertainment is a fistfight.

The woke is trying to do something about this. They're trying to use cancel culture to change human nature. However, Bill Maher predicts that it's not going to work.

> If you’re part of today’s woke revolution, you need to study the part of revolutions where they spin out of control because the revolutionaries get so drunk on their own purifying elixir they imagine they can reinvent the very nature of human beings. Communists thought selfishness could be cast out of human nature. Russian revolutionaries spoke of “the new Soviet man,” who wasn’t motivated by self-interest but instead wanted to be part of a collective. No, it turns out he wanted to be on a yacht in a Gucci tracksuit holding a vodka and a prostitute, not standing in line all day for a potato.The problem with communism—and with some very recent ideologies here at home—is that its proponents think you can change reality by screaming at it, that you can bend human nature by holding your breath. But that’s the difference between “reality” and “your mommy.” Lincoln once said that you can “repeal all past history, [but] you still cannot repeal human nature.” But he’s canceled now, so fuck him.

The revolutionary idea of yesterday is that selfishness can be eradicated from human nature. The revolutionary idea of today is that biological constraints can be eradicated from the human body.

> The insane arrogance of thinking your revolution is so fucking awesome, and your generation so mind-bendingly improved, that you have bestowed upon the world a new kind of human, you’re welcome. With communists, that new human was no longer selfish; in America today, that human is no longer male or female. And obesity is not something that affects health, you can be healthy at any size.

Much like communist countries, the woke America is becoming a nation of snitches.

> Snitch Nation isn’t about what side you’re on, it’s about this mindset where everyone is an amateur secret policeman and tattling is a virtue. The woke side of the Internet thinks going through someone’s old MySpace account makes them part of the resistance.

They are on a futile mission to rid people of impurities through shame.

> Andy Warhol was wrong: in the future, everyone will experience not fifteen minutes of fame but fifteen minutes of shame.

Meanwhile, its detractors have their own snitching practices.

> Texas’s abortion law includes the idea that anyone even helping a woman get an abortion, like the Uber driver who takes her to the clinic, can be sued by some random Citizen Snitch for up to $10,000. Finally a way to tap into that vast reserve of Uber-driver wealth.

Ayn Rand is not all that intellectual. If you discover someone to be a fan of Ayn Rand, watch them closely because they may be an imposter, a pseudointellectual.

> Paul Ryan once said Ayn Rand taught him “what [his] value systems are.” And I believe him, because her book has a strange appeal to people who are kind of smart but not really. She wrote things like “Money is the barometer of a society’s virtue” and “The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me”—which sounds like something a Batman villain says. It’s all stuff that seems very deep when you’re nineteen years old, about how government is a dirty trick played by the weak on the strong.

Or, they may be a libertarian. But where is the line between libertarianism and selfishness?

> Libertarians have to stop ruining libertarianism, or at least do a better job of explaining the difference between today’s libertarian and just being a selfish prick. Like, when you see a stoplight your reaction should be “Great. An easy way to ensure we don’t all crash into each other,” not “How dare the government tell me when I can and cannot go!”“Seat belts? I refuse to live in a nanny state—I’m an individual, and I want to soar, free as an eagle, right through the windshield.” Same thing with meat inspectors—who needs ’em? “People can sniff their own meat! And if a few die, the word will get around town: ‘Don’t order the T-bone at the Ponderosa,’ and then the Ponderosa closes—problem solved, thanks to the free market!”

You don't have to follow traditions, especially bad traditions. It's okay not to join a fraternity. You'll turn into a better person without it. Don't put yourself in a situation where you will have to waste your time deprogramming yourself from a cult.

> When a girl says, “I’m dating a frat guy,” no one ever asks, “Oh yeah, what’s he like?” “I just told you—he’s a frat guy.” Of all the bad things fraternities do, the absolute worst is that they take young people at the exact moment when they should be learning to be individuals and turn them into shit-eating, orders-following groupthinkers. My college had a lot of fraternities, but it never occurred to me to join one, because finally in my life I was able to live on my own, away from family and among women; it had no appeal when some frat guy said, “Hey, how about coming with me to live with a bunch of dudes? Come on, we’ll stick a carrot up your butt.”

There's no such thing as an elite college anymore. There's only expensive college.

> Elite schools should no longer be called elite—just say “expensive” now. Which may be why they breed a particular brand of detestable graduate.

In *Ministry of Truth*, Steve Benen noted that Republicans no longer allow any time to pass before they rewrite history. They rewrite history in the making of it. Bill Maher seems to agree.

> These guys are like Pinocchio, except when they tell a lie their balls grow bigger.

Capitalism breeds addiction. A successful product is an addictive one. The market will select a company that can best skewer regulations around addiction. The market does not select the most ethical company.

> When I heard this—that Apple, Google and Facebook are essentially drug dealers—I thought: “Where have I heard that before?” Oh yeah, it was on the famous 60 Minutes episode where tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand admitted, “We’re a nicotine delivery business,” and Mike Wallace said, “And that’s what cigarettes are for?” Wigand: “Most certainly. It’s a delivery device for nicotine.” Yup, it was never about “smooth tobacco flavor”; it was about the nicotine and other drugs that cigarette makers deliberately put in to make it addictive. The moral rot in this country began when corporate America decided it wasn’t enough just to successfully sell your product. People needed to be addicted to it.

Even though the alarmist attitudes about TV were largely misplaced, the alarmist attitudes about phones are valid.

> TV didn’t turn people into assholes: shady, needy, passive-aggressive, mean and fake: fake outraged, fake brave, fake pretty, fake supportive—phones make people fake their lives instead of living their lives. It’s more important to get a picture of you looking like you’re having a good time than actually having a good time. And the pathetic addiction to “likes.” “Did they like my picture? Maybe it wasn’t good enough… maybe that means I’m not good enough!” Phones have ruined self-esteem, comedy clubs, concerts, childhood, attention spans, sleep cycles, using toilet time to reflect and falling off cliffs. Oh, and dating, which has been reduced from a quest for true love to looking at a menu: “I think I’ll have the Kelly tonight.” Phones make people bullies. Angrier, more vitriolic, more racist online than they would ever dream of being if they had to say those things to someone’s face.

A former VP at Facebook admits that addiction to social media is destroying society.

> The short-term, dopamine-driven feedback loops that we have created are destroying how society works.

To teach a young person why staring down at his phone during a conversation is rude, when he starts talking, open up a magazine and start reading.

> Cell phones have obliterated courtesy—the fundamental building block of developing any real relationship. We all see it—groups of friends out together at a bar or eating in a restaurant and they’re all staring down at their phones. Imagine how rude that would be if, instead of a phone, you brought a magazine to the table and read it during dinner with a “friend.”

Before speaking out about a purportedly offensive statement, first reflect on whether it is offensive in the first place. If it's directed at a particular community of people, ask that community whether the remark was offensive to them. We have become to jumpy, as in we started jumping to outrage at any trigger, no matter how minor. We have to snap out of these destructive impulses, and Maher suggests doing so through the power of deliberation and talking to the groups of people we believe to be acting on the behalf of.

> A hallmark of stupid wokeness: getting offended for people who themselves would not be offended. Democrats have gone from the party that protects people to the party that protects feelings. From “Ask not what your country can do for you” to “You owe me an apology.” Republicans apologize for nothing, Democrats for everything—can’t we find a balance?

A theater slaps a trigger warning on *Romeo and Juliet*.

> London’s Globe Theatre felt the need to tell the audience that its production of Romeo and Juliet includes suicide.

How can trigger warnings and spoiler alerts coexist in the same time?

> It does kind of give away the ending. I don’t understand how a society that’s so in love with spoiler alerts can also be into trigger warnings: tell me what’s gonna happen—but don’t tell me!

Market research doesn't work, questionnaires do not work. People will not admit their true nature. To find out who they really are, observe them.

> If you want to know who someone really is, ignore their avatar and check out their web browser history.

Most people are perverts.

> Look at a list of popular porn categories: cuckold, cheerleader, stepmom, double penetration, creampie, tentacle sex—it sounds like we’re playing Password for perverts.

And yet, college students are offended by everything nowadays. 

> Kids used to go to college and lose their virginity—now they go and lose their sense of humor.

For many, college is a drinking camp, a microcosm of a society trying to get through a pandemic or repressions.

> As long as I had liquor, I didn’t care that there was no toilet paper. But as a historical trend, this can’t be good. There’s a word for when everyone in society gets drunk just to get through the day. And that word is: “Russia.”

Bill Maher is on a crusade to rid society of stupid ideas. He thinks religion is a stupid idea.

> I’m the only live-action television figure who consistently puts religion “under attack,” and I’ll be damned if the credit’s going to go to the entire Left when I’ve been doing all the heavy lifting.

He laments that this is a quest often attributed to the whole of liberal media and resents this characterization.

> Where is religion belittled in the liberal world?

He notes that even those accused of satanic practices will thank God in their award speeches, should they win any awards.

> Counterculture types, like devilish musicians? Have you ever watched an awards show? Every speech is “I want to thank Jesus, without whom I could never have written ‘Face Down, Ass Up.’”

Religion is still considered a norm in the American society. Even in the 21st century it is unpopular to have no religious affiliation.

> Even an intellectual president like Obama, who admits to being a “secular humanist” (wink wink—atheist), had to pretend to be religious. No one has been able to admit their shameful secret: “I don’t believe in ghosts.”

At the heart of religion is the belief that human beings should be shamed and shunned for their sexual desires. An attempt to control people through this sort of emotional blackmail still drives many of our government's policymakers.

> This creepy substrain of Catholic conservatives who think “limited government” means government should put a limit on people’s sex lives.
