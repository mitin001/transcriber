The system of government we have in this country has worked for its citizens so far.

> This system has worked for centuries and pretty well.

It's arguably been the least bad government on the planet.

> We've never had a stronger economy. We've never been more productive. We've never been more everything. And yet here we are starting to take apart the pieces that actually quietly hold it together.

Can it withstand the fascist takeover by the likes of Trump and Musk?
