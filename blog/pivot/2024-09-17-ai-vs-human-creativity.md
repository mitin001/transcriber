> We've dumbed down much of what we consider journalism on the internet to a level that it actually is replaceable by an anodyne LLM.

The fact that we're even considering an LLM as a replacement for our work shows how much we've dumbed down our work.

> The more anodyne what you're doing is, the easier it is for it to be replaced.

AI is here not to replace us but to remind us that we've got to get back to express ourselves uniquely.

> Try to find unique ways to express yourself that are not based on everything that you hear every day.

Creating content that's like everything else is not an option anymore because AI can do it immediately and in infinite quantities.

> Uniqueness is going to be at a premium.

But AI can never beat human creativity.

> It's going to have a much harder time replicating that creativity.
