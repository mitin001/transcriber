> DeepSeek released a highly competent model from China. And kind of part of the reason I took the market by storm is the thesis was that it was created for a lot less money and a lot less compute. And what I think is there's certainly some parts of the story that are incorrect.

- If it uses large language models that were developed expensively, can we really say that it's a cheaply made product?

> I would speculate with some vigor that they actually had some version of access to larger models in helping training.

- If you use ChatGPT to make your own LLM and then overtake ChatGPT's market share, aren't you a snake that's eating its own tail?

> It could be that they had some kind of access to ChatGPT. Certainly some of the data and evidence suggests that in terms of the way that it answers.

- DeepSeek seems to be the latest in the long tradition of China making an offbrand of a Western product by imitating it.

> Yeah, who would have thought that China would engage in IP theft to create a cheaper product?
