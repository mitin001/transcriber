Scott Galloway explains that Trump's cryptocurrency grift does far more harm to the individuals than just steal their money.

> You're taking time from their kids. You're taking their retirement.

Had these people kept their money, they could stop working sooner and enjoy more time with their kids. People like Trump don't understand that once a normal person makes enough money to survive and thrive, they want to spend the rest of their time with their loved ones. People like Trump don't understand this because they don't love anyone. Life is a game to them. For them, the winner is one who can steal the most money.

> When the person in charge, the person who's supposed to be the ultimate exemplar of trying to prevent a tragedy of the commons, engages in the theft of other people's time and money, the whole fucking thing collapses.

Trump is showing people that the only way we can survive is forget our loved ones and play his game of who can steal the most money.

> Then everyone wants to be in on the grift.

By playing into the worst human instincts, he shows that stealing is how we survive in this country while simultaneously breaking down the institutions that could prevent this.

> It's a race to the bottom.
