Why is TikTok so addicting?

> It responds to everyone in the way they like.

This is also what makes ChatGPT so addicting. It got to be so successful because by repeating the words of the person promoting it, the AI bot pleased everyone. People got addicted to reading their words sput back at them by a machine.

> I used to think we were an attention economy. Now I'm totally sold on the fact that we don't. We live in an addiction economy.

At this stage, capitalism makes people not into consumers anymore, but into addicts.

> If you look at the companies over the last 50 years that have had the greatest returns, they're really salty, sugary food companies and/or tobacco companies or they're pharmaceutical companies.

Corporations used to be able to compete based on quality, not they compete on how to skirt regulation that was intended to keep them from harming society.

> Our entire economy runs on addicting people to content, sugary, shitty food, and then treating them.

The types of industries that prosper in the late-stage capitalist society are those benefit from there being addicts.
