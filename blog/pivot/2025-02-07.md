# [2025-02-07](https://s3.amazonaws.com/writecomments.com/transcripts/b170abc35d40f4ed701f931f2b52cc0e.csv): America got the leaders it deserved: its two scammiest businessmen, Trump and Musk

An insurrection happened on January 6, 2021. It failed. The second insurrection happened on January 20, 2025, with the help of Elon Musk.

> The wealthiest man in the world who, in my opinion, is trespassing on federal property.

Elon Musk figured out that when it comes to personal responsibility, things are far less risky than they seem. People with power are on an honor system with regulators, and if such a person has no morals, there's not much in their way.

> He blows up rockets until he gets it right. I was like, this is a person with a high risk tolerance who has noticed that when you break things or break rules or open your company when the government of California says not to, they don't stop you.

The legal system is slow and can't catch everyone who breaks the law. Elon Musk understands that if he breaks enough, some of what he breaks will never get repaired, and he's counting on that.

> Even if he gets stopped later, he's already broken it.

The country has picked two of the scammiest businessmen to lead it off a cliff.

> The government's role isn't to start cosplaying business. Trump has been cosplaying business his whole life. This is the reality of Trump. If he had invested his father's massive fortune, which he inherited, in any index fund, he'd have more money than he has now.

While Musk suffers from delusions wherein he thinks that we live inside a video game and that none of his actions have consequences, Trump is a rich kid that's never been taught accountability.

> The general reputation of Trump and his family was they were a bunch of rich kids who didn't know what they were doing, that they just weren't very good at what they did.

There's a parallel between Trump's relationship to the Republican party and how a media company operates.

> Only one hit carries all the losses.

Media companies often rely on there being a single hit to pay off their investments for the year. This is what happened to the Republican party. Trump is their hitmaker now. No one in the party can stand up to him because the party won't survive without him. And this is how they've allowed for a fascist takeover of the government that now only serves one man: Elon Musk.
