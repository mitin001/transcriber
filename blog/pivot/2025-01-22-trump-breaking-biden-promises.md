Switching political parties at the helm of American government every four years has rendered the US unserious to the rest of the world.

> We are not a serious people. We're in the World Health Organization, we're out. We're in the Iran nuclear deal, we're out. We're in the Paris Accords, we're out. We're in, we're out again. We're banning TikTok, bipartisan legislation, signed into law, *oh, just kidding, we wanna do a deal*. Our ability to, for our enemies and our allies, to take us seriously around anything has been so dramatically diminished.

Switching political parties only works when they respect each other enough to maintain a degree of permanence to the rest of the world. A Republican must keep the promises made to the world by a Democrat and vice versa.

> The back and forth, the lack of consistency, the lack of respect and regard for established treaties, precedence of the previous president, is hurting us. We are no longer a nation. We're a platform for making money and dividing the spoils amongst an increasingly few number of people.

Without this mutual respect, the US devolves into a kleptocracy.
