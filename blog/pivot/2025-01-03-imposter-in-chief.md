In our imposter culture, most people holding important positions are completely unqualified for them. Trump is peak imposter culture. He came into the presidency of the United States not knowing even basic grade-school-level things about the world.

> He had to be told that there were two Koreas.

To make sure your kids don't turn out like that, teach them things. If they're not listening to you, make sure they have people they look up to who can teach them things.

> If your son is not listening to you, even if you're a dad, find a friend to talk to him. Kids are more likely to listen to their father's friends sometimes than their father.
