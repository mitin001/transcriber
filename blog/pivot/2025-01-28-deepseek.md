The market responds to the release of DeepSeek by significantly pulling down the valuation of Nvidia.

> Nvidia's down 15 or 16%. It's shed something like a half a trillion dollars, which basically, if you take out Tesla, it's shed today the value of the entire global automobile industry.

That is, back to its valuation from October.

> This is pretty dramatic, but at the same time, that just takes it back to its valuation in October. And when you look at market dynamics, when these companies have experienced these type of run-ups, it is like a balloon inflating beyond its natural capacity, and the slightest touch can pop it. And so in some ways, the market was probably looking for an excuse to take these stocks down a bit, and it got it.

The market tends to overreact. What shoots up will plunge down. This is not an indication that DeepSeek is going to disrupt the industry. This is an indication that Nvidia isn't going to disrupt it either.
