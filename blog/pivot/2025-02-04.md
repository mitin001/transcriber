When you ask ChatGPT a question, it returns the average of all the paragraphs in its model that pertain to your query. OpenAI has been putting those paragraphs into their model out of all sorts of sources regardless of whether they are protected by copyright. Now DeepSeek is copying ChatGPT's responses into its own model, and Scott Galloway approves.

> They have crawled your book, they are using your IP without paying you. So Deep Seek, bring it on, copy that bitch. Do to him what he's been doing to us. I am so here for Deep Seek.

He doesn't want to hear Sam Altman complain because Altman is the one who started this practice of training models on copyrighted material without paying the original authors.
