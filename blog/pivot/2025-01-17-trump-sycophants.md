Why are so many CEOs such sycophants for Trump?

> From a shareholder's perspective, these guys can't break out of the cycle of shareholder value.

Being sycophantic is in their nature. That's what made them CEOs.

> The reason they're CEOs is they're supposed to be fiduciaries for shareholder value.
